				About Me
			</h2>

			<p className="personalInfo">
				I graduated from Lake Forest College (Illinois, USA) in 2019 with a BA in Finance. Shortly after graduating, 
				I embarked on a journey to help solve various technological problems for small businesses in eSwatini and South Africa. The more I learned about the various
				problems, technologies and potential solutions, the more I became enamored with software engineering. My journey then led me to becoming 
				a Full Stack developer because I was inclined to pursue a career that would allow me to
				use my creativity to bridge my imagination with reality and solve complex problems with software.
				I am passionate about learning new technologies, creating and designing high quality solutions/experiences. 
				I enjoy reading comic books, experimenting with my cooking as well as watching and critiquing movies.
