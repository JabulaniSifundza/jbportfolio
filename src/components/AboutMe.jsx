				About Me
			</h2>
			<p className="personalInfo">
				I'm Jabulani JB Sifundza, a driven MS Finance student at Illinois Institute of Technology, specializing in Quantitative Finance and Technology. 
				With a foundation in finance from Lake Forest College, I've blended my passion for problem-solving with technical expertise. 
				My experience as Co-Founder and Software Developer at Ndali in South Africa allowed me to leverage Python, machine learning, and financial analysis to drive tangible results, including significant revenue growth and improved customer segmentation. 
				I'm skilled in data analysis, financial modeling, and developing data-driven solutions. 
				Currently, I'm honing my quantitative finance skills through rigorous coursework and projects, such as the Chicago Quantitative Alliance Investment Challenge, where I developed advanced trading strategies and automated compliance checks. 
				I'm passionate about creating innovative solutions that bridge finance and technology, and I enjoy exploring new technologies, cooking, and cinema in my free time.
